### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Glad to meet you! 
I am a Front-end Developer who have a strong feeling for UI-UX and psychology. 

As a Front-end Developer, I desire to use my obssesstion to details to enjoy working on products with visual attracting UI and at the same time bringing in the smoothest UX that could improve the quality of our daily lives.

### 🤖 Few things about me

- 🛠   Currently working on improving my test writing skill and exploring the Back-end development world.
- 📚   Looking for opportunities to study more about UI-UX, visual effects and animations.
