### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Glad to meet you! 
I am a Front-end Engineer with a strong feeling for UI-UX and psychology. 

As a Front-end Engineer, I desire to use my obsession with details to work on products with visually attractive UI and, at the same time, bring in the most comfortable UX that could improve the quality of our daily lives.

### 🤖 Few things about me 
- 💻   I'm experienced with most of the up-to-date Front-end technologies out there (especially with the React ecosystem): React, redux, Tanstack Query, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, ... You name it!
- 🎨   I love building web interfaces.
- 🛠   I aim to strengthen my technical skills and my speech articulation.
- 📚   Looking for opportunities to dive deeper into large-scale systems, optimizing SEO, building design systems, and micro-frontends.

### 🥷🏻 Get to know me in person
- I'm an ambivert who likes spending my personal time alone and socializing every now and then.
- I'm a huge fan of story-telling video games since I can explore new things from different perspectives.
- I love animals and would like to understand them as much as human beings. 🐯🦁🐒🦅
- I'm fueled by coffee. ☕️
